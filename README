This is a Web Site for My parents Enterprise, I made it with rails, and fancy-box in order to have a special effect.
For the moment I posted it at Heroku, just in order to show it, but i have a problem, the page take too much time in order to works fine.
Maybe the problems are with the images that I have use tiny images in order to have the same aspect.
Now my images size are around 250kb per image, and I used around 10 images and, also i need to used another ten for the fancy box effect.

I will change the weigth of the images in order to make it run faster.

pls if you want to add some more effects or maybe want o discuss my code, just email me or twitter me >D
